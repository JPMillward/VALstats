# VALstats

Github repository for a personal data analysis project involving the VALORANT Match API. Also doubles as the dataset being used for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, 

Primarily written in Python, automated using unit / timer scripts on a personal linux server.

Data is called from the API, then cleaned and dumped into a SQLite3 database built to house the match data. Key constraints ensure data integrity across tables.
